# Learning Journal, Code 301, day 19 â€” *Shayne Smith*

Our team certainly is dedicated, I must say. Gabe and Kavdi were apparently here until 2am. There are commits to prove it.

Additionally, I overheard Nathan saying that he would like to be referred to as "comrade"... I feel like I've missed an opportunity this whole time.

This has been a great time at Code Fellows... and I am sad to leave. I've formed some very good friendships here over the last two months. But there is a wide world out there, and someone is in desperate need of a front end developer/designer.

I thank my classmates, my instructor, Nick -- thank you -- and all the wonderful TAs that made this one of the most exciting and challenging experiences of my life.

Thank you,
Shayne

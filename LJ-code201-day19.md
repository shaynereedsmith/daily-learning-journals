# Learning Journal, Code 201, Shayne Smith -- Day 19

Today was the day things broke.

As expected, many things that we tried to change or improve ended up breaking the whole game.

We were told this would happen, so when it DID I didn’t act surprised and I didn’t worry.

My team is really good. So far we have been able to overcome any obstacles and make a product that we actually care about.

I’m excited about presenting this. My team is excited. We’ve made something we actually like. And now that the game itself is basically finished (except for a few minor changes and polish) it’s cool to actually play it and see how far I can get.

We had play testers today. Which was a great experience. It was fun to see people freak out when they aaaaaaaalmost beat a character or when they laughed at the jokes or the dialog. Many also admired the amount of work that must have gone into this project, which is more appreciated than anything — because yes, we DID put a lot of work in.

# Learning Journal, Code 301, day 10 — *Shayne Smith*

We were introduced to functional programming today, which is great. I believe that much of this functionality relates directly to what we’re doing in Code Wars. I’m going to attempt to do that now.

I have to leave early today, which is not in my character to do, but I’m going back home for the weekend to see my family, so I think it’s ok.

# Learning Journal, Code 201, Shayne Smith -- Day 14

Code review of Bus Mall. Again, like with yesterday, it’s interesting how many possible ways there are for doing the same thing. Development is really an art and you can see the personality of each person in these labs.

This CSS reading is really great stuff. I love seeing what other designers and developers are doing and what they’re trying to teach to others. UX is an overlooked art for many in this class. I understand that most people want to learn the logic, and so do I, but I also understand that the experience of the user is vital, because that’s what people see when they communicate with your code.

---

Lots of cool project ideas. This is a really creative class!

---

This functional programing stuff is going to make constructing our game much, much easier. I can already see how this is going to come in handy.

I understand what Nic says about ternary code, that if he taught it on day 3 we would be totally confused, but at this point I just sort of feel betrayed, haha!

---

This team programing is pretty interesting. Because we only have 3 people in our team, we can’t split into two pairs so we are triple-teaming this project.

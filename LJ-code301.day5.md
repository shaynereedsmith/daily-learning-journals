# Learning Journal, Code 301, day 5 â€” *Shayne Smith*

Today was pretty laid back. I started the day having completed all of my assignments already, so there was plenty of time for me to review what I've been working on and try to understand previous days work. I also was able to spend some time tinkering with the styling on my portfolio site.

The *Power Hour* today was great. The speakers were my favorite so far, and I think I learned a lot about how to become a more valuable job-seeker.

Code review was both amusing and useful.

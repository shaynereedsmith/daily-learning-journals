# Learning Journal, Code 201, Shayne Smith -- Day 11

CSS code review is pretty fun. This is the sort of stuff that really appeals to me, coming from a design background. There is so much flexibility with CSS.

I had my Bootstrap page reviewed by the class. I was very happy with the response. It feels good to be recognized for something. :D

---

We went out to (not)look at the eclipse. Human beings are funny things.

---

The project for this week already looks massive. Haha! I don’t know how much I’m going to get done of this in just the one day… it seems like a lot to figure out.

---

Trying to figure out how to locate what is happening when the element is clicked is proving problematic.

There are 6 of us left here and I’m a little amazed at how other people have gone home. Did they all figure it out?

---

Nothing seems to be working right. I’m very close to scraping the last 9 hours of work. I’m about to submit the worst assignment of my life.

---

Just FYI: it’s “innerHTML” not “innerHtml”

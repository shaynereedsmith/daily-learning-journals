# Learning Journal, Code 301, day 11 — *Shayne Smith*

It’s officially day 11 and I’m still up from the night before. Just finished the quiz, still have two pair programming projects to do and my portfolio project.

Will try to get some sleep and get back to work in the morning.

The pair programming didn’t go super well. I don’t think either myself or my partner had a good grasp on what was expected, and time was a huge constraint.

We did what we could for as long as we thought was reasonable and submitted what we had knowing we would be marked down.

We were.

This is the first time I’ve done that here at Code Fellows. Normally I will stay on campus and work until tasks are COMPLETED. This time, it just wasn’t going to happen.

I suppose there’s a time for everything.

We intend to rework this and get it up to spec.

The lecture was a bit of a blur. Maybe I’m just tired from last week and the weekend (I didn’t really get any rest). I’ll do my best tonight to grasp as much as possible so I can be useful to my partner in the morning.

---

Teams were announced. I’m very happy with the results. I am hoping that we will be able to create an amazing app that will wow everyone. Being that I’m currently unable to continue on to a 401, I have to make as big of a splash as I possibly can now and hope there’s enough gnar (and good references) to ride into a job.

# Learning Journal, Code 201, Shayne Smith -- Day 4

The DOM, in referring to “documents.” is recognizing the whole of the HTML document as a JavaScript object, which can then be navigated through with dot notation.

So in the same way that an object has “properties” that can be called like “object.property”, so too can you access elements in an HTML document with JavaScript by using the DOM tree commands, so if I wanted to select a “h1” element in my document using JavaScript I could use “document.getElementsByTagName(‘h1’)[0]”

As a visual learner, navigating through the DOM tree makes a lot of sense to me.

As someone who’s studies theology, I was able to make a connection of The Trinity as it relates to the DOM: The Trinity = Father (object), Son (subject), Holy Ghost (union); analogously, the DOM = HTML (object), JavaScript (subject), DOM (union).

The DOM does not exist anywhere. It is neither subject or object; it has no literal or metaphorical position. It is the way of unifying your HTML-CSS with the spirit of JavaScript.

About to leave for the meet-up… I feel like I’m heading in the wrong direction. Hopefully, with a little time and a mental reset, I’ll be able to tackle this thing and get it finished before the days end.

---

Returned from the meet-up and I’m not further along. I’m starting over on this and starting from ground zero in hopes that I’ll be blessed with a new perspective.

At this point it’s like I’ve been stressed out about finishing this lab on time and I’m literally no closer now than I was 8 hours ago.

---

I’ve been up all night getting this lab prepared for the morning. How terrible!

I’m going to be quite sleep deprived.

# Learning Journal, Code 301, day 12 — *Shayne Smith*


So…. Yah. Hey, how’s it going?

I’m behind. More-so now than I’ve ever been or ever thought I would be.

My portfolio is in a state of disarray, I’m going to be two full days behind on that. I have partner lab assignments that I intended to come back to later because they were submitted unfinished. I’m even going to fall behind on Code Wars soon. Ack!

On top of all of this I might have an interview with Helpful Humans for a front-end JS developer. I’ve got their interview problem from GitHub already (thanks to Matt, the investigator), and it looks like an all-day project for me. I hope I get the interview and the opportunity to test myself with that problem. But even just the fact that I’ve been able to get that far based on what little I know right now and how my resume looks is a good sign.

I went to OpCode last night with about a billion other Code Fellows, hah! It was actually really cool. I’ve got a good writeup about it in my canvas submission.

# Learning Journal, Code 301, day 9 — *Shayne Smith*

Nick recognized that many people were mentioning in their learning journals that they didn’t feel like they understood the content from class and labs, so he took everyone in for 3 hours and built a grocery store app from scratch so that we could go through the process step-by-step.

This was very helpful, honestly, and I think that many people in class are in agreement about that.

We are continuing to build on the store app as part of today’s lesson. It would be nice if there was somehow an extra 3 - 6 hours in the day so that we could learn like this every day and still have time for labs.

This grocery store app we are making is extremely helpful!

As per usual, the moment I think I’m starting to grasp a concept, another layer of complexity is thrown in to throw me off. (re: nested SQL).

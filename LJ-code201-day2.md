# Learning Journal, Code 201, Shayne Smith -- Day 2
I haven't been in school for a long time, so all of this is quite a shock to my system.

Today was a reasonable amount of HTML/CSS, which I am actually *quite comfortable with*, and the JavaScript is actually not too bad to manage, either: really, it's a matter of research and trial and error and experimentation.

However, the *GitHub* and *terminal* stuff has been a big struggle for me. It's one of those things that makes me feel like I'm falling behind and loosing ground. I only hope I can make up for it in other ways and just **TRUST** that I'll eventually get all that stuff out of experience.

The small of my back is feeling a bit tight.

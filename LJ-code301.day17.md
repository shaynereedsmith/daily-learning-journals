# Learning Journal, Code 301, day 17 â€” *Shayne Smith*

Second day went quite smoothly if I do say so myself. We were very productive and got a lot done.

This morning we are presented with a site that you can log on to using slack. It's pretty awesome. I stayed up late doing a lot of stuff on the front end, trying to get it to look just right.

I was able to pair-program for a solid few hours with both David and Gabe, which was good.

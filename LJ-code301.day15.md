# Learning Journal, Code 301, day 15 — *Shayne Smith*

As my time at CodeFellows comes to a rapid end, I find myself becoming reflective of my life for the past two months.

This place has been my everything. It’s taken priority over my wife and son. I mean, I’m doing this for them, but my attention has been 90% focused on school.

I feel very attached to my classmates and can already feel myself getting emotional about our time together ending. Some of my friends here have become better friends than many I’ve had back home for decades.

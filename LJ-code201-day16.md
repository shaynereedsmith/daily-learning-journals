# Learning Journal, Code 201, Shayne Smith -- Day 16

Project week!! What what!

I really like my team. They’re an awesome couple of guys and we are getting along really well.

It’s helpful that our project is something we’re really excited about. It’s cool when you work hard simply because you want to see the product actualized.

The stand-up was a lot simpler than I thought it would be. It probably helps that we have the whole week basically planned out in Trello, so at this point we just need to stay up to date with what we are working on individually… I think.

All-in-all this game is moving along very smoothly.

My team went to the JSHackers meeting together tonight. It was nice. We got to talk to plenty of new people. We even got to show our project around. It's amazing how far having an eye for design can get you... nobody seems to like it that much, nor do they seem to want to deal with CSS much, which happens to be my favorite part of all of this so far.

# Learning Journal, Code 301, day 18 â€” *Shayne Smith*

Lots of work today!

I had my hand in the database and SQL, which is a challenge for me (being a visual person) but it was good to get into it -- I'm aware that I really need to learn how to do SQL and other backend stuff that I'm not naturally comfortable with using... because that's just the reality of the situation.

While attempting to make the site more mobile responsive, I ended up delving into things so deep that it just fucked everything up. I ended up junking hours of code because the changes I made -- which were an attempt to fix a viewport-size issue -- actually ended up importing the problem I was having with the mobile view into the desktop view. What a disaster!

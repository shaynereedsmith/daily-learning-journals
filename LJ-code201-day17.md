# Learning Journal, Code 201, Shayne Smith -- Day 17

Second day of project week. We were able to get a MVP and I’m actually pretty proud of our team for all that we’ve been able to accomplish in these last two days.

We have an awesome display for text events, and selection elements are working great. We have all the logic and there is basically a game there that can be played.

The next few days will be about refining that game to be as fun as possible, which includes creating assets that are suitable for the brand of the game that we’ve set thus far.

My job going forward will be to create the assets needed to make this game as cute and fun as possible. I will likely be incorporating some simple hand-drawn animations.

We shall see.

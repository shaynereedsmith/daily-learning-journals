# Learning Journal, Code 301, day 2 — *Shayne Smith*

This morning I wrote a function in jQuery. It did what I wanted it to do and I got very excited about that.

I kind of felt like I was starting to actually be a programmer.

And then the assignments happened and it was salmon cookies all over again!

Well, I say that, but it is different. At this point I actually understand (to some extent at least) how to manipulate the DOM using jQuery, however keeping track of all the things I’m supposed to be doing before 1pm tomorrow — getting the two different GitHub repos that I’m supposed to be checking right, which I seem to always get wrong whenever I’m checking — is proving the most difficult thing.

It seems like every thing I do needs several steps just to get started. That’s pretty annoying… but if that’s just how the industry is and I need to suck up and get used to it, then I’m going to do it.

I haven’t slept well ever since I’ve been back in Seattle and it’s really starting to weigh on me.

Money struggles, too, are weighing on me.

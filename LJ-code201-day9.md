# Learning Journal, Code 201, Shayne Smith -- Day 9

I find myself being intimidated by my own code. Is this normal? When it works it feels precious and I don’t want to hurt it. It’s like a fragile egg that I really need to have do work but if I upset it too much it will explode and make a huge mess.

---

A big problem is inexperience in naming variables. When I go back to work on my code, I find that I don’t know what certain variables are doing because I’m not good at naming them… because I don’t really understand what I’m supposed to be doing with them.

Gabs is really bright. We’re reviewing his code right now. There are some really bright people in this class. I feel like I’m somewhere in the low end of average — I still don’t completely understand why the code I write works when it does, or doesn’t work when it doesn’t. I understand the logic when it’s explained — it seems perfectly logical, you create a function for arguments which are variables that are used multiple times. It makes sense. However, knowing how to recognize when to do what and troubleshoot is a huge challenge to me.

I feel in over my head. I imagine others feel the same.

I feel like I need to completely remake this lab from Tuesday onward to truly understand what the fuck I’m doing here.

Matt just shared my exact sentiments. When we are going over code in review, things make sense with the class network and instructor attention on one thing, but when I go back out on my own actually applying that stuff to my own code, which looks very different, makes my mind draw a blank.

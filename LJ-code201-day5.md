# Learning Journal, Code 201, Shayne Smith -- Day 4

* Refined the final answer on the day 4 quiz to get the last question right.
* Did some git review in the morning. This was helpful.
* Getting the project ready using git is difficult. Though an essential skill to learn. After some work, this part is still hard to understand.
* JavaScript problems are very specific. I debugged problem 2 by capitalizing a “t” to make the function work.
* Serious impostor syndrome today. I feel completely out of my element. The instructions come across as gibberish when I read them, and even though I try to write out the formula based on what the instructions are asking word-by-word, nothing is making any sense.
* This JS work is very frustrating. I can hear other people working on questions 4 and 5 while I’m stuck on 3 and I don’t understand it.
* I was completely wrong in the code I was doing. I have to abandon the code I had and try to understand what other people who are successful are doing. Loading a single variable into an array feels weird to me, but I guess that’s just what the project is. Right now I feel like my ability to learn this is limited. We shall see if this changes. Moving on to problem 4.
* After talking to some other classmates and TAs, the things started to make a lot more sense: I was not distinguishing number vs arrays. Things are going much more smoothly now.
* Problem 4 was easier. I am starting to develop a method of writing out literally what the problem is in the function, and working backwards from there to translate it into logic instead of words. ASIDE: my code wasn’t working, couldn’t figure out why — turned out to be a absent “r” in “array” — go figure!
* I had another “English” error in my function that caused it to be false until it was fixed.  What a difference a “.” makes!

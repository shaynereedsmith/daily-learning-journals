# Learning Journal, Code 301, day 13 — *Shayne Smith*

So, deployment stuff today. That’s pretty cool.

When I evaluate my experience in 301 so far I must say that it’s mostly been introduction to tools with the expectation that I’ll actually “get it” when I either practice on my own or am forced to become proficient on the job.

I really hope I can find a job based just on what I’ve learned here. I’m guessing it would probably be best to get more work with SQL and really trying to lear as much as I can about database tables.

The kilovolt blog was successfully deployed. I’m hoping to get my.

Going to another meet up tonight. Hope to get an even better feel for this tech scene.

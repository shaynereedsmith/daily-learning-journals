# Learning Journal, Code 301, day 14 — *Shayne Smith*

Interesting class today. I think that going through and building an app from scratch using all the things that we’ve learned so far is really useful. If we were to do something like this every day I’m sure I would get this stuff down. My personal problem as a learner is that I do well with repetition. Unfortunately that’s not really the way the stacked learning method works… but I’ve been trying my best to adapt.

I only hope that this will be enough for me to get work out there… somewhere.

# Learning Journal, Code 301, day 8 — *Shayne Smith*

I wish I had some sort of context that would help me to understand this stuff more clearly. As it stands, I’m basically floating in the water, and I have a bunch of tools to build a boat but don’t even know which way to go.

Looking at CodeWars right now: I don’t know how people actually understand this. The fact that this problem looks like gibberish to me is telling.

It turns out I was looking at the wrong challenge. My previous point still stands, and also this problem is very difficult for me, too. I simply don’t know how to do this.

New day. Going over the previous days work was good.

I’m understanding the stacked learning system more and more each day: the amount of information we were given just in the 3 hour lecture today could have been a week long full-time course.

But we will learn it, apply it, and move on to something else tomorrow and continue to use the tools from today as though it’s implied.

That’s how we get so much information crammed into our heads in such a short time.

It reaffirms my faith in people to see too many of us struggle with this and persist to the next day.

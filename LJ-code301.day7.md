# Learning Journal, Code 301, day 7 — *Shayne Smith*

I thought that yesterday was a bit of an overload. Now I’m kind of scared for tomorrow.

The backend stuff is so overwhelming to me, I feel like I did with salmon cookies — except more.

We’ve spent several days now learning what feels to me like aspects of all-new languages every day. And today is a magnification of that.

I’m not quite sure where to start but I’m going to do my best, because this is the path I’ve chosen and I’m committed.

Beyond that I feel completely lost with this.

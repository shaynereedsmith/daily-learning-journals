# Learning Journal, Code 301, day 16 â€” *Shayne Smith*

First day of project week!

I like my team. We are quite capable and are apparently getting a lot done.

We got the Slack API working in terms of delivering messages and challenging people to ping-pong matches.

I also got a parallax library up and working, which took a good while but is tooootaly worth it.

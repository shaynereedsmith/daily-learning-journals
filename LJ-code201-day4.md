# Learning Journal, Code 201, Shayne Smith -- Day 4

Today was our introduction to *Pair Programing*.

I can really see the benefit of doing this for teaching/learning reasons. However, I'm struggling to understand how this is a valuable approach in the real-world in terms of maximizing worker time in pushing out quality products on a deadline.

As with most things, I'm simply submitting to what my teachers and TAs say and trusting that what they are telling me is best.

# Learning Journal, Code 201, Shayne Smith -- Day 3

Today was a good day. Long and exhausting, but good.

Our lab -- updating questions in JS to our "About Me" pages -- went very well. I had an *ah-ha!* moment when writing the code for question 7. It came after I made the mental connection that "for (--this = true --)". I had noticed other people trying to ender "x === true" and realized that it was totally redundant. It was at that moment that the syntax clicked.

Beyond that, my understanding of ordering code and the **child-parent** relationship became more sophisticated.

Honestly, I was feeling pretty confident with my understanding of styling while scripting was feeling a bit foreign. Now that I've been able to connect some of the dots in JS, I believe progress with the language will come more readily.

These are long days, but they are rewarding days. This is quite possibly the hardest thing I've ever done, which gives me a unique opportunity to push myself and see how much I can grow.

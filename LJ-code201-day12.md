# Learning Journal, Code 201, Shayne Smith -- Day 12

We are currently doing code review. I think Mark has a lot of good natural instincts. As per usual, looking at things makes increasingly more sense as it is reviewed, but confidence in actually being able to create code of this level myself is low.

These chart making tools are interesting. ChartJS seems to be the tool of choice. I can already tell the most difficult part of this task for me is going to be getting the chart to know how to read the information I want it to display.

The chart was not too difficult after all. Getting it to style is a neat experience. I will probably try to add some more features as the day goes on.

I spent quite a while trying to figure out some new CSS stuff. Specifically, animation. I find UX to be one of the most interesting parts of web development.

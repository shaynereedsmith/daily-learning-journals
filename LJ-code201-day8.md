# Learning Journal, Code 201, Shayne Smith -- Day 8

Code review was a great learning experience. Kinley did her lab completely differently than I did. It was fascinating to see how they were trying to make the constructor dynamic to the nth degree.

I learned a lot.

The blog construction in class has been very valuable. I hope that this will help me understand actually working The DOM better, because yesterday I struggled a lot with that, which was disheartening because I thought it would be something I’d pick up naturally.

The amount of data that can be accessed by events is substantial. Our ability to access this data through dot notation of the event object gives us a massive amount of power.

I’m really learning the nature and usefulness of dot notation, especially as it pertains to objects and events.

As with most days, I assume that the “ah-hah” I’m feeling now will quickly evaporate during the lab project.

I was able to finish the lab today and actually did a hefty portion of it on my own. This was quite a satisfying experience for me. I’m sure  it will not be duplicated tomorrow.

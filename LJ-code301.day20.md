# Learning Journal, Code 301, day 20 â€” *Shayne Smith*

Presentation day. So very emotional.

I've made so many good friends during this short two months. Really, some of the best people I've ever known. I am so grateful for this experience. I'm very sad to be going but excited to start on this new life.

I've loved this time and I hope to keep it close to my heart for years to come, and stay in contact with my friends as well.

# Learning Journal, Code 301, day 4 — *Shayne Smith*

The structure of the classes is kind of throwing me off. I’m loosing track of what day it is and it’s hard to establish a workflow.

I’m looking forward to a break this weekend, although I do like the work we do — it just gets quite tiring being at school from 8:30am to 10pm every day.

Pair programming went well today. Rob has a solid mind. So does Shannon. In many ways I wonder how others perceive me and my level of skill… I know I have a reputation for styling/CSS/design stuff, but I DO wonder if it’s a compensation-type-deal.

Anyway… I’m very tired. And my profile page is broken. The rest of my work is done so I hope to get this problem solved tomorrow morning when I have more support and assistance.

# Learning Journal, Code 201, Shayne Smith -- Day 7

This has been an interesting day.

I’ve gone from not understanding things at all, to understanding them a little bit, and now to feeling a bit comfortable as I approach the DOM for creating this list out of my cookie store content.

I now regret my earlier confidence. I am just as lost on this as I was yesterday, if not more so. Getting these tables to display simply isn’t happening and I don’t know how to make it work.

The stuff in the book doesn’t seem to be working even if I copy it directly just to play around with.

---

Working with my colleagues, once again, proves useful.

This class is a collective mind of sorts. I don’t think that any single person’s work is completely their own; rather, what we end up with at the end of the day is a combination of various ideas and coding styles.

I suppose that since all of us are students, this we are still developing our own styles of coding — our own unique nomenclature, perhaps.

I’m beginning to weigh perseverance with rest. I’m quite tired and would like to leave, but all of my eggs are in this basket and I can’t afford to fail.

# Learning Journal, Code 201, Shayne Smith -- Day 10
---

Doing code review… I’m finding that JavaScript is a strange combination of logic and spacial language.

For instance, when we want to access the number of entries in an array, we use “array.length”, so we are accessing a spacial representation to identify which number entry we want, and from there we can apply a formula to say which item in the array we want.

Coding is a very unique way of communicating. It’s language that has an objective visual element.

The presentations and the lunch talk were actually really great. I learned a lot from watching other students share what they’ve made and hearing what they have in mind. Some of these ideas are really good. And the talk had a lot of invaluable information. I asked a question about something that I really wanted to know, and got a great answer back!

The CSS project today was actually pretty fun. I had a good time driving for my partner, Michelle, and I think the page we made was damn-near perfect. If we’d had a bit more time it would have been spot-on!

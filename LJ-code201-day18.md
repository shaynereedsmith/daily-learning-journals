# Learning Journal, Code 201, Shayne Smith -- Day 18

Day three of project week 201!

We did so much today that it’s hard to remember any single thing.

There were some issues with the combat system which we were able to debug pretty quickly. Then Max wanted to include a feature where they enemy attacked you back (previously it was a stat-check with a small randomizer and whoever’s stats were higher made a hit). It took a while to get done but I’m glad we did it because it makes the game a lot more dynamic.

Not that I can say it enough, but I really like my team. I hope they like me also and feel that I’m contributing. I’m really trying.

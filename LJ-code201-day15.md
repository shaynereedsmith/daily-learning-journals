# Learning Journal, Code 201, Shayne Smith -- Day 15

I came into class this morning and was pleased to hear that others were very upset about that TEDx video, as I was.

I’m excited about JQuery. The syntax of JS is something I struggle with, but I’m fine with the pseudo-code. JQuery is kind of like doing pseudo-code but it actually does what you’re saying.

That part of 301 is exciting.

This GitHub stuff is a little weird.

My team had the time to lay out a plan for our group project. We are very excited about this. We have MVP and stretch goals. It seems manageable.

I got marked down AGAIN for not submitting a pull request link when the canvas submission form asks for a repo link, not a PR. This has been the most annoying thing about CodeFellows.

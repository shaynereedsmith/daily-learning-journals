# Learning Journal, Code 201, Shayne Smith -- Day 13

Code review is a trip today. This project is probably the most individual specialized one we’ve done yet; it seems as though everyone has done this thing a slightly different way. I’m also learning some valuable things about event listeners (specifically, how to use event.targeting).

We are going through some of the basic salmon cookie stuff with appending the list properly into the HTML with JS. I actually think this is good and useful. I see other people working while this is going on (I suppose I am, too, because I’m writing this) but it’s going to do a LOT for some of the people who’ve been struggling (myself included) to really digest the material we’ve been consuming over the last week.

The aspects of the lab today were actually kind of fun to work with. I’m hoping that I’ll be able to recall

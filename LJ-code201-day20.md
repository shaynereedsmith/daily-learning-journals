# Learning Journal, Code 201, Shayne Smith -- Day 20

Today was presentations!

Very exciting. Very cool.

There was a lot of really polished work and some great features from a lot of my classmate's projects. What a good group of people!

This has been a seriously important experience. I've learned so much from the class and my classmates and TAs and Nick. I have to thank everyone. They've made this experience away from my family a positive one.
